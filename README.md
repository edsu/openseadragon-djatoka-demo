This repository contains a simple demonstration of using [OpenSeadragon](https://github.com/openseadragon/openseadragon) with a [Djatoka Image Server](http://projects.freelibrary.info/freelib-djatoka/) using [Islandora](https://github.com/Islandora)'s [Djatoka TileSource](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_openseadragon/blob/7.x/js/djtilesource.js).

The easiest way to understand it is to look at the [demo](https://edsu.github.io/openseadragon-djatoka-demo) and view source. Well, as long as the demo Djatoka server is running at least. But hey, we're all moving to IIIF now anyway right? Right?
