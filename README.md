This repository contains a simple demonstration of using [OpenSeadragon](https://github.com/openseadragon/openseadragon) with a Djatoka Image source using Islandora's [Djatoka TileSource](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_openseadragon/blob/7.x/js/djtilesource.js).

The easiest way to understand it is to look at the [demo] and view source. Well,
as long as the Bodlian's Djatoka server is running at least. But hey, we're all
moving to IIIF now anyway right? Right?
